<p>Handy solution to grep and kill process by process name.</p>

<p>When Celery workers are not properly shutdown their will be background celery workers running and they needs to be killed. Eg:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ps -ef | grep celery | awk {'print $2'} | xargs kill
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or you can install “htop”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sudo yum install htop</p>

  <p>sudo apt-get install htop</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Along with procesess you can now see memory/cpu/pid information press F4 to filter processess based on keyword, then press Enter and press F9 to kill.</p>
